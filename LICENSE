## Attribution & Sponsorship

While this software is provided under the permissive MIT License, we kindly request:

1. **Attribution**: Keep the "Powered by LinkPage" footer when possible
2. **Sponsorship**: Consider sponsoring the project on GitHub Sponsors to:
   - Hide the attribution footer
   - Support continued development
   - Help sustain the open source ecosystem

The footer can be hidden by setting `hideFooter: true` and `sponsoredOnGitHub: true`
in your configuration, but we ask that you only do this if you're actively
supporting the project through GitHub Sponsors.

This approach helps ensure the long-term sustainability of the project while
providing maximum freedom for all users.

Thank you for supporting open source! ðŸ’–
